100 Days of Code Challenge Projects

Day 3 Project - Form Practice

This is my first project that I have been working on locally and been pushing updates to GitHub. I started it on Day 3 of my 100 Day Challenge and will most likely update it and add onto it as my coding skills improve.

Please check it out live if you're interested at the web address below.
